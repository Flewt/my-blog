      <h2> Final Reflection</h2>
      <h3>What went well?</h3>
      <p>
        There are a few things that I am really happy with this term. I started off strong and I'm very pleased with my initial planning and figjam documentation. I feel like it was a marked improvement from last term. I also feel like I'm comfortable with the ideation and research phase. I'm really happy that I was able to pivot on my initial problem and find something that I was fired up about. Finally, I am feeling so much more confident about coding. Last term I was very worried that I hated coding, but having spent some time on my own getting to grips with the basics, I've found I quite enjoy it. I realise I'm still really behind, but I'm happy with the progress and confidence I've gained.
      </p>
      <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
      <p>
        This term was a lot to self-manage. I discovered that I really really struggled with the trasition between phases. Each time I needed to switch focus to something new and plan each step involved with that, eg moving from solution to brand design, I would get overwhelmed and not want to do it. Juggling class interruptions in the middle of the day, as well as two summatives only added to this.
      </p>
      <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
      <p>
        I still have a lot of coding to catch up on. I think I can help my difficulties with the transition between phases of the design process by having templates and checklists on hand ahead of time. I think developing a more regular check-in schedule with the lectures will help my with organisation.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What actions will I take for the next step
      </h3>
      <p>
        For next term I want to have steps and resources planned out ahead of time, and well as schedule weekly check-ins.
