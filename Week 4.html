        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>What went well?</h3>
        <p>
Not much honestly. I managed to get an all nighter in and actually presented on my presentation day.

        <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
        <p>
STRUGGLING to focus. Something about the switch from problem to solution has been really difficult for me, despite how enthusiastic I am about this project. I think I'm scared of not being able to do everything I want it to be able to do. I feel like I've got a good idea and I'll screw it up. I'm just journalling now. Hi Simon or Melody~.

        <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
        <p>
I don't know. My brain? I've got all the pieces in place. I liked my outline for the term. Things were going well. Now I'm massively behind. I think I really need to make the daily check-in the first thing I do each day. Then I can do a bit of school and at least something gets done. If I start something else in the morning, that's it. I'm probably unproductive for the rest of the day.

            Now I play two weeks of catch up.
