            <p>
              On Friday I was exhausted and didn’t manage to do anything outside of class. I did manage to organize and upload my blog
              Today I need to meet with Simon to discuss changing my topic
              Current blockers are feeling exhausted and being behind on programming</p>

            <h3>Tuesday 6th May April</h3>
            <p>Yesterday I met with Simon to discuss changing my problem to the difficulty of making an educated voting decision. I then started my secondary research
              Today I need to document the secondary research and book interviews.
              Current blockers? Not sure right now. Feeling a bit stressed that I’m now behind. Don’t know how to get interviews in before submitting the WIP slides</p>

            <p>Yesterday I finished my secondary research.
              Today I need to finalise my interview questions, schedule interviews, and prepare my WIP slides
              Currently blocked by the WIP slide being due tonight. No one wants to interview until tomorrow when that due date is out of the way (understandably)

            <p>Yesterday I made my wip slides, finalised interview questions, and scheduled interviews. Today I will be doing interviews and doing WIP01. Currently feeling blocked by needing to wait for interviews</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>What went well?</h3>
        <p>
I'm really glad that I decided to pivot my problem this week. I'm genuinly fired up about this issue and there are great solution options that I can already think of. I also really appreciated the WIPs. There a several things I've seen other people doing in their project that I realise I probably need to do as well.
        </p>
        <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
        <p>
I feel like I haven't done enough this week. I delayed research because of the change in topic, which meant that by the time I wanted to get interviews in, people wanted to push them back to after WIPs. Definitely feeling a lack of direction the last couple days
        </p>
        <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
        <p>
My understanding of the process
        </p>
        <h3>
            What actions will I take for the next step
        </h3>
        <p>
            I need to go back to last term and look at the process we followed to figure out what I need to do.
