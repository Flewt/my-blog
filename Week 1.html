            <h3>Wednesday 30th April</h3>
            <p>Yesterday, I set up my figjam board(s) so that I can keep all the lecture notes and resources organized
                and separate to the summative work. Today I have scheduled the term. Current blockers are feeling
                overwhelmed with things to organise. Now that the term is scheduled out, Iâ€™m hoping that will be easier

            <p>Yesterday I brainstormed protential problems. Today I need to identify a problem and start research.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>What went well?</h3>
        <p>
This week, I am really pleased that I came in expecting to hit the ground running because the work load started immediately. I struggled to get into the flow last term, so I'm glad that I was more prepared this time. I was especially pleased that a lot of feedback from last term is being taken on board, and this term looks to be structured more fairly.
        </p>
        <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
        <p>
I fell behind in coding last term and I don't feel like I learned anywhere close to enough. The bootcamp really highlighted that to me. It doesn't help that I had such a bad headache on that day that I have had to put the work off, probably until the weekend.
        </p>
        <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
        <p>
I will need to catch back up in coding very quickly.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What actions will I take for the next step
        </h3>
        <p>
            I will be practicing my coding over the weekend. BOOTCAMP time baybee.
