            Today I need to get the lo-fi done and sent for approval.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <h3>What went well?</h3>
      <p>
        This week I finally sat down and spent a few days really getting much more confident with HTML and CSS. I actually feel like I have an idea of what I'm doing and that feels great.
      </p>
      <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
      <p>
        This week I put my lo-fi together and it felt like pulling teeth. Every single thing feels like there should be a "right" answer for where it should go and what it should look like but I don't know what that is. I also know that I should be coding already, which puts extra pressure on trying to do things quickly and I have really struggled under that pressure.
      </p>
      <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
      <p>
        In terms of precess, I think I need to allow myself more time to experiment with the wireframe and mess around, rather than trying to get it right first time. That will allow me to feel more confident moving onto lo-fi and hi-fi.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What actions will I take for the next step
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will be getting the ok on the lo-fi, move onto the hi-fi, and hope like crazy I can get something ready for the final presentation.
